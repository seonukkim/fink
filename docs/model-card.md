# FInk Model Card

Status: scaffold.

FInk does not require a remote runtime model. Any future local model may explain
retrieved evidence but must not create legal evidence, directly set production
risk scores, or fabricate financial impact.

Model research policy:

- Default license floor: `public_open`.
- Automatically eligible licenses: Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD, ISC, CC0, and
  CC-BY-4.0 style licenses.
- Unknown, missing, gated, custom, noncommercial, and research-only licenses are
  rejected by default.
- Public Git may contain only model IDs, licenses, pinned revisions, configs,
  benchmark summaries, and selected profiles.
- Weights live under `$PRIVATE_ROOT/models` or the Hugging Face cache, never Git.
- The Hugging Face token is loaded only through
  `scripts/model_research/run_with_hf_auth.sh` and is never printed, logged,
  copied, documented, or committed.
